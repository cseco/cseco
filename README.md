CSECO is a mechatronics engineering company. But wait, what is mechatronics? - A synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electronics, computer engineering, telecommunications engineering, systems engineering and control engineering. (The word itself was derived from **Mecha**nics + **elec**tronics) And that is what we do. See our [products and services](#products-and-services). ***At CSECO we use the disciplines of mechatronics to build circuits that collect data from the physical world which we then use to control some parameter of some system of the physical world.*** 

CSECO (acronym for Circuits and Systems Engineering Company) is a registered trademark of Circuits and Systems Engineering Company Ltd.

### The Company

CSECO, the leading mechatronics company in Kenya, designs and builds mechatronic systems that collect data for intelligent control in the agricultural, building, energy, transport, water sectors as well as both inside and outside of the home.


### Technology expertise

We are committed to fostering invention, discovery and technological exploration in the pursuit of practical and valuable mechatronics products for the agricultural, building, energy, transport, water sectors as well as for the home.

CSECO is at the forefront of developing hardware and software technologies in the areas of IoT, robotics and mechatronics with a rich pool of expertise in mechatronics, robotics,	IoT, embedded systems,	native,	Android	and web programming. The systems we build are optimized using insights from the data they collect or from data collected from elsewhere, and at their output is also so much data that cannot be ignored. We seek to build an ecosystem of mechatronic systems and data to enable the smart farm(agriculture), smart bike(transport), smart meter, smart building, smart home both through internal initiatives and by building strategic external partnerships.
