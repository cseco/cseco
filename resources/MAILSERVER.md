## Setting up a Mail Server

Our chosen VPS host is [upcloud](http://upcloud.com/). And this because they have a free one month trial without any restrictions - a very attractive offer. Log in to you account, go to servers. Then deploy server. Once the server is deployed you will get a password to log in to the server with as root. But you will need to change this to a safer practice - disable root login using password. 

How you log into the server
```sh
	ssh root@ip-address-server
```

Buy a domain from [godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or [sasahost](sasahost.co.ke) (for .ke domains)

Change the nameservers for the domain you bought to [1984](https://www.1984hosting.com/). This will give us a central place to control our domains which be buy from different places, only going back there to renew them. Here are the 1984 nameservers:
- ns0.1984.is
- ns1.1984hosting.com
- ns1.1984.is
- ns2.1984hosting.com
- ns2.1984.is
